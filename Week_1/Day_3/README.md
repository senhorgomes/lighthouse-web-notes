### Tips from Day 3

* Primitives are
  * undefined 
  * Boolean
  * string
  * null
  * number
  * symbol

* Objects aren't primitives(Arrays and functions are considered Objs)

* In Objects, keys are always strings. Each Key is unique and can only contain one value. However, that value can be an Array with multiple values. 

* To cycle through the Keys in Objects, you NEED to use `for in` loops. Or else it will not be iterable.

#### Keep on using other type of For Loops
Today I actually effectively used `for of` and `for in`. It made coding things a lot easier and simpler. Goal of Day_2 accomplished!!!!
