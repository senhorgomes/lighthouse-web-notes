### Tips

* Create a branch to not mess with the master use the `git branch` to make or transfer into a new branch.

* Upload changes to the old branch so the master branch isnt messed with. Use `git add .` to add everything or `â€”all` / `-A`

* `git merge` to merge your branch to your master

* `git push origin master`(master branch) or `git push origin -u`(adding the branch at the end) by using the -u command, you can then just use the `git push`command over and over. `git checkout` (switches branches)

* `.forEach` can be used effectively

* `parseInt()` extracts the number
* `isNan()` checks if its not a number

#### Make it so functions are reusable. Dont specify functions too much.
